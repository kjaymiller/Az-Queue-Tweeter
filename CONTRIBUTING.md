# Contributing to the project

## Forking the project
If you want to contribute to the project, you can fork it on GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Using Poetry
Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Install Poetry by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).


**Once you have Poetry installed, you can install the project dependencies by running `poetry install` in the project root directory.**

## Running the tests
To run the tests, you can use the `pytest` command.
